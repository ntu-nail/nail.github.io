abstract: Link prediction on knowledge graphs is useful in numerous application areas such as semantic search, question answering, entity disambiguation, enterprise decision support, recommender systems and so on. While many of these applications require a reasonably quick response and may operate on data that is constantly changing, existing methods often lack speed and adaptability to cope with these requirements. This is aggravated by the fact that knowledge graphs are often extremely large and may easily contain millions of entities rendering many of these methods impractical. In this paper, we address the weaknesses of current methods by proposing Random Semantic Tensor Ensemble (RSTE), a scalable ensemble-enabled framework based on tensor factorization. Our proposed approach samples a knowledge graph tensor in its graph representation and performs link prediction via ensembles of tensor factorization. Our experiments on both publicly available datasets and real world enterprise/sales knowledge bases have shown that our approach is not only highly scalable, parallelizable and memory efficient, but also able to increase the prediction accuracy significantly across all datasets.
