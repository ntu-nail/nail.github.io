abstract: Paraphrases are texts that convey the same meaning while using different
  words or sentence structures. It can be used as an automatic data augmentation tool
  for many Natural Language Processing tasks, especially when dealing with lowresource
  languages, where data shortage is a significant problem. To generate a paraphrase
  in multilingual settings, previous studies have leveraged the knowledge from the
  machine translation field, i.e., forming a paraphrase through zero-shot machine
  translation in the same language. Despite good performance on human evaluation,
  those methods still require parallel translation datasets, thus making them inapplicable
  to languages that do not have parallel corpora. To mitigate that problem, we proposed
  the first unsupervised multilingual paraphrasing model, LAMPAT (Low-rank Adaptation
  for Multilingual Paraphrasing using Adversarial Training), by which monolingual
  dataset is sufficient enough to generate a human-like and diverse sentence. Throughout
  the experiments, we found out that our method not only works well for English but
  can generalize on unseen languages as well. Data and code are available at https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/
  LAMPAT.
