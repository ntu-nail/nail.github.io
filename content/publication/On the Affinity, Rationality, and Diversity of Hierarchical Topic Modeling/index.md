abstract: Hierarchical topic modeling aims to discover latent topics from a corpus
  and organize them into a hierarchy to understand documents with desirable semantic
  granularity. However, existing work struggles with producing topic hierarchies of
  low affinity, rationality, and diversity, which hampers document understanding.
  To overcome these challenges, we in this paper propose Transport Plan and Context-aware
  Hierarchical Topic Model (TraCo). Instead of early simple topic dependencies, we
  propose a transport plan dependency method. It constrains dependencies to ensure
  their sparsity and balance, and also regularizes topic hierarchy building with them.
  This improves affinity and diversity of hierarchies. We further propose a context-aware
  disentangled decoder. Rather than previously entangled decoding, it distributes
  different semantic granularity to topics at different levels by disentangled decoding.
  This facilitates the rationality of hierarchies. Experiments on benchmark datasets
  demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, effectively improving
  the affinity, rationality, and diversity of hierarchical topic modeling with better
  performance on downstream tasks.
