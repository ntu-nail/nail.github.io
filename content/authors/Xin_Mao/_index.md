I am a research fellow at NTU advised by Prof. Anh tuan Luu. My current research interests lie within Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (esp. Large Language Model Alignment and Graph Neural Networks). Before joining NTU, I received both my bachelorâ€™s and my Ph.D (Computer Science, 2020, advised by Prof. Man Lan) degrees from East China Normal University.
