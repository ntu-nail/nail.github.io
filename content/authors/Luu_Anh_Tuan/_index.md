Hi! I am Luu Anh Tuan, an Assistant Professor at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL and a member of the Natural Language Processing group under the supervision of Prof. Regina Barzilay from 2018 to 2020. I obtained Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University in 2016. From 2016 to 2018, I was a research scientist at Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore in the Natural Language Processing group of Dr. Jian Su.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing with the focus on applications of pretrained language models, semantics, question & answering, information extraction and knowledge construction, robustness & trustworthy AI, and recommendation systems.
