Hi, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University, advised by Prof. Luu Anh Tuan.
My current research interests primarily focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing, with a particular emphasis on LLMs' planning and reasoning capabilities.
Before joining NTU, I received my masterâ€™s (Computer Science, 2020, advised by Prof. Man Lan) degrees from East China Normal University.
