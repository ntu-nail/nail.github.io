I am a second year PhD student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and DAMO Academy of Alibaba Group in Singapore. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from NTU. My current research is focused on improving the reasoning abilities of large language models and exploring their practical applications.
